# Customer Password Reset

This is sample code for how to implement your own HTML page for
resetting customer passwords. This will require one HTML and one JS file
that you will need to host on your own domain.

`index.html` is the HTML file you'll need to serve up to your customers.
`reset-password.js` is what will handle the requests to the Particle API
to actually reset the customer's password.
